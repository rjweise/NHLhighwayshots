Scripts for showing shots and goals on highway in 2017 2018 season


Purpose is to get data, probably from NHL API, with the following:

REQUIRED
- shots (excluding blocked shots and missed shots)
- goals
- shot location
- goalie who stopped the shot or let in the goal

NICE TO HAVE
- strength
- date, game period and time
- NHL gamenumber
- shot and goal data from different source to have an idea how complete the data is from NHL API. I noticed some shots / goals are missing x/y locations, or missing the Goalie on Ice.
